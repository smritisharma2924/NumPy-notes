# 📊 NumPy Learning Series

I created the **NumPy Learning Series** 📚 during my sophomore year while learning and practicing NumPy. <br>
These Jupyter notebooks (`phase-*.ipynb`) document my learning journey — from array creation to reshaping and more. <br>
They’re not just for me — they’re also for anyone who wants to **revise the basics** or learn NumPy step-by-step in a clear, structured way.

---

## 📌 Features
- Well-structured **Jupyter notebooks** for easy learning.
- Beginner-friendly explanations with practical code examples.
- Expandable series — more `phase-*` notebooks coming soon.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

### 💻 Installation
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/smritisharma2924/NumPy-notes.git
   cd NumPy-notes
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Open the desired phase-*.ipynb file and start learning!**

## 📖 Current Progress
   1. **phase-1.ipynb —** Imports, array creation, list vs array, creation functions, attributes, reshape & transpose <br>
   2. More phase-* notebooks coming soon! 🎯
