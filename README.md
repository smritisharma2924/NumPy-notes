# 📊 NumPy Learning Series

I created the **NumPy Learning Series** 📚 during my sophomore year while learning and practicing NumPy. <br>
These Jupyter notebooks (`phase-*.ipynb`) document my learning journey — from array creation to reshaping and more. <br>
They’re not just for me — they’re also for anyone who wants to **revise the basics** or learn NumPy step-by-step in a clear, structured way.

## 📌 Features
- Well-structured **Jupyter notebooks** for easy learning.
- Beginner-friendly explanations with practical code examples.
- Expandable series — more `phase-*` notebooks coming soon.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
